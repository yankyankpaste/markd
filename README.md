## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]()

Lovely stuff, so spent just a few hours over this week on this, managed to only get so far...

- [x] can create bookmark, added to local storage
- [x] added url validation
- [x] added pagination (hard to see without many results but wrote this as a self commenting usePagination hook)
- [x] nearly all components and utils (hooks) are written from ground up incase this was deemed cheating otherwise!

Think would be useful to talk through and explain process. I also spent some time in framer to create initial screens. I cant share these easily (bloody accounts) but Ill try showing the most here...
